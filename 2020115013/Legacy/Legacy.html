                        <p class="backcardpara">While RCB claimed the highest ever team total against Pune in IPL 2013, Chris Gayle created history to register the highest individual score in IPL. The Jamaican scored an unbelievable 175* to propel RCB to a total of 263 runs in their 20 overs. Gayle’s 175* was not only the highest individual score in IPL but also became the highest individual T20 score by any batsman.</p>

                        <p class="backcardpara">In Match 31 of the 2013 IPL edition, RCB produced one of the most stunning batting onslaughts ever in the history of T20 cricket. The now-defunct Pune Warriors India was on the receiving end after captain Aaron Finch won the toss inserted RCB to bat first. However, what followed was absolute carnage with Chris Gayle being the chief tormentor with an unbeaten inning of 175 at the M.Chinnaswamy Stadium. In doing so, RCB also registered a total of 263/5 making it the highest team total in the IPL history.</p>

Taking CLT20 exploits (424 runs) into account, Kohli has scored 6140 runs which are by far the most a player has scored for a single IPL franchise.</p>

This is indeed is an IPL record for RCB given Kohli has captained all his matches in the IPL for the Bengaluru-based franchise.</p>

                    <h4 class="rivalcontentsubtitle">RCB vs KKR</h4>
                    <p class="rivalpara">A heated rivalry has existed between KKR and RCB right from the first match of the edition itself where the RCB was inflicted with perhaps the most humiliating loss ever I'm the history of IPL. KKR crushed RCB defeating them by a humongous 140 runs on the inaugural match of the inaugural edition of IPL on 18th of April 2008 at Bangalore.
                        After that day, these two teams have met a total of 27 more times which have all ended in heated competitions. If you are looking for passion in IPL, there is no other match than RCB vs KKR where you will find it. There have been sparks flying all around every time these two teams meet at the center. The infamous fight between the then KKR captain Gautam Gambhir and the current RCB captain Virat Kohli stands testimony to the above statements.Out of the 28 encounters so far KKR has undoubtedly emerged on the top winning 15 matches while RCB has managed to win 13. The last encounter between these two teams took place on 18th April 2021 which resulted in a RCB victory by 38 runs.</p>

                    <h4 class="rivalcontentsubtitle">RCB vs CSK</h4>
                    <p class="rivalpara">Chennai Super Kings and Royal Challengers Bangalore are two super giants of the Indian Premier League. The clash between these two teams have always attracted a lot of attention from fans, ever since the inaugural edition of IPL in 2008. A match between these two teams is more than just a game of cricket. It is a rivalry so big that the match between RCB and CSK is also known as Kaveri or the Cauvery Derby, or the South Indian Derby or Namma Derby and sometimes also the El Classico of IPL. As of the 12th edition of IPL held in 2019, these two teams have faced each other for a total of 22 times- 18 times in the League Stages, 3 times in the Playoffs and once in the finals which was won by Chennai Super Kings. Apart from IPL, CSK and RCB have faced one another in the Champions League T20.If we take an overview of the statistics of the clash between these two teams, it is beyond any doubt that CSK emerges on the top by a huge margin. Out of the 28 encounters so far CSK has won 18, while RCB have managed to win only 9 and one remained without any result.</p>

                    <h4 class="rivalcontentsubtitle">RCB vs MI</h4>
                    <p class="rivalpara">On their first ever IPL encounter on 20th April, 2008, Royal Challengers Bangalore defeated Mumbai Indians by 5 wickets. Bangalore also managed to bag a victory over the Indians in their last encounter in 2021 by 2 wickets on 9th of April, 2021 at Chennai.
                        The clash between Royal Challengers Bangalore and Mumbai Indians have been one of the most exciting fixture in every IPL by far. Although Mumbai has been overwhelming dominated the Challengers, but the encounters between them have been the most entertaining ones. Out of 30 encounters so far, Mumbai Indians have won 19 and Royal Challengers have won 11.
                        While RCB is captained by the current Indian National team captain, Virat Kohli, the Mumbai Indians would be captained by Rohit Sharma who is the Indian Cricket team vice captain for the limited overs format.Also RCB has never ever won an IPL trophy but Mumbai Indians have won 5 IPL trophies and are subsequently the team with the highest number of IPL trophies with chennai behind them with 3 IPL trophies.
